- A markdown file can be included in another markdown file using an `$include` statement _in a paragraph by itself_.
  Example: `$include(another-file.part.md)`. Note: using the `.part.md` extension is not required, but it suggests
  that the file is not a standalone file (e.g. it typically won't have a title).
